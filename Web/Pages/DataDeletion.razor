    <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Deletion</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">This site does not collect personal data for tracking, analytics, or
    advertising. Therefore, there is no personal user data stored by the site to delete.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">No Data To Delete</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Because we do not collect or retain personal data tied to individual users,
    you will not find any personal profile, history, or analytics associated with your visit that
    can be deleted from this service.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Server Logs</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The server may produce minimal technical logs used for operation and
    debugging (request timestamps, response codes). These logs are not used for user profiling and
    are kept only as required for service stability. If you have concerns about logs, contact the
    site administrator and we will review any specific request.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">How to request deletion</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you believe we are storing personally identifiable information about you,
    please contact the site administrator with details and we will investigate and, where
    appropriate, remove or anonymize such data.</p>
