    they are strictly for essential functionality and will be clearly disclosed to users.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Third parties</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">We do not share personal information with third parties for tracking or
    advertising. If third-party services are used, they are chosen with privacy in mind and will be
    documented here.</p>
